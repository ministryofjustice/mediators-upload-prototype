# Family Mediators Data Upload Prototype

Uses the GOV.UK prototype kit to create dummy prototypes/flows/pages for user research and dev example purposes.

For more on how the kit works, see its own [readme](govuk_prototype_kit_README.md) file.

Auto deploys to [https://moj-mediators-upload-prototype.herokuapp.com/](https://moj-mediators-upload-prototype.herokuapp.com/) which is passworded to prevent public users from finding it and trying to use it.
